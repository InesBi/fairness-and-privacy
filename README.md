# fairness-and-privacy
This assignment explores variations on the theme of private logistic regression.
We will provide code that performs non-private logistic regression, from which
you can adapt your private algorithms. Each question uses a different set of pri-
vacy assumptions to reflect the variety of contexts that inform private machine
learning in practice.
